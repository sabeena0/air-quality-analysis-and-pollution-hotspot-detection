# üåç Pollution Hotspot Detection and Visualization

## Overview
This project analyzes pollution data to identify the **most polluted cities** and visualize them accurately on an **interactive Mapbox scatter plot**.  
The goal is to provide clear insights into geographical areas with high pollution concentration.

---

## Features
- **Data Cleaning**:  
  Handles missing (`NaN`) values to ensure stable and error-free plotting.

- **Hotspot Identification**:  
  Selects the most polluted cities based on pollution averages.

- **Interactive Mapping**:  
  Uses Plotly's `scatter_mapbox` to plot pollution hotspots with dynamic zoom, hover info, and color gradients based on pollution intensity.

- **Error Handling**:  
  Prevents crashes by pre-validating input data for plotting.
